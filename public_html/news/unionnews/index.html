        <font face="Arial,geneva,helvetica" size="2">Twenty-five entrepreneurs from 12 local colleges will be honored for their innovative <b>business</b>
ideas during the first annual awards banquet for Entrepreneurship
Initiatives, a segment of the Harold Grinspoon Charitable Foundation.<p></p>
The banquet is scheduled for April 29 at the Log Cabin in Holyoke. All 25 <b>students</b> have received monetary awards during the 2003-2004 academic year through the program.<p></p>
"There will be a lot of recognition for <b>students</b>,
which is important," said Linda M.L. Peters, program director for the
initiative. "The projects are varied. They're simple to involved."<p></p>
The initiative began in September to encourage young people to turn their innovations and creativity into <b>businesses</b> that will produce economic opportunity and growth in the Pioneer Valley.<p></p>

<b>Student</b> entrepreneurs are matched with advisers to help them realize their <b>business</b> dreams. An advisory committee of area entrepreneurs and academics provides additional guidance and consultation.<p></p>
"They're (the <b>students</b>)
amazing," Peters said. "A lot of them have ideas and want to be
entrepreneurs but had no idea how to go about doing it. Every school
has a faculty adviser who helps them through the process."<p></p>
Roger J. Roberge II, a senior marketing communications major at Western
New England College in Springfield, used the initiative to help bolster
his marketing consulting company, Remagine. He received $2,400, which
will cover the operating expenses for his computer server for one year.
Remagine provides mostly Web site design and Web hosting facilities.<p></p>
"The grant has really put me in a position to be a major competitor in
the game," said Roberge, 21, who graduated from Cathedral High School.
"It is very difficult to be a young entrepreneur. When you're just
getting started and trying to make a name for yourself, this helps."<p></p>
Jeff Taylor, founder and chief executive officer of Monster.com, will
be the keynote speaker at the banquet, which will feature an "Elevator
Pitch Competition." <b>Students</b> from each school will compete for $7,000 in monetary awards by pitching a <b>business</b> concept to a panel of judges from area banks. <b>Students</b> will also display information about their <b>businesses</b> or innovations.<p></p>
The foundation was created by real estate mogul Harold Grinspoon years
ago. He founded Aspen Square Management, a West Springfield-based
company, 45 years ago.<p></p>
