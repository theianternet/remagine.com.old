2/28/03
I want to take this opportunity to honor the memory of my father who passed away
this week.  If it wasn't for his teaching, indulging and encouraging, I wouldn't
be coding this or any software.  One of my best memories is when I was about
8 years old he would take me to work to help him run the card sorting machine
on the government computer he worked with.  The first complete program I wrote
was when I was 15... I wrote a comprehensive accounting package for the Commodore
64 so he could do his business finances for the shop he owned.  Hard to believe
it all fit on a 360k 5 1/4" floppy disk, eh?
