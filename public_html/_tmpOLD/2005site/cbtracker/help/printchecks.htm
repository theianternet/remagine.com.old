Checks<br>
</font></h4>
CheckBook Tracker offers the ability to print checks on predesigned
form checks available from most check printing companies.&nbsp; Due to
the magnetic ink used in checks, CBT is not able to print checks on
plain paper (and neither can any other check printing software.)<br>
<br>
Checks are generally printed in batches.&nbsp; Enter several
transactions, choosing "Print" as the transaction number.&nbsp; After
several transactions have been entered, choose "Print Checks" from the
"File" menu.<br>
<br>
The number of checks to be printed will show at the top of the
dialog.&nbsp; Below this you can select the check number of the first
paper check you are about to print on.&nbsp; You can also specify how
many checks are on the first page.&nbsp; This way you don't waste forms
when you have already used one check off a page last time you printed,
just select that there are 2 checks remaining, and CBT will start
printing there.<br>
<br>
Many users will want to have both a carry-along checkbook and printed
checks. These will use different numbers.  The idea is that you can
enter your daily checks normally, but when it comes to paying bills,
print out 1 to 30 at a time that you have already queued.<br>
<br>
If you want a check to be printed in a batch, you enter it like a
normal check, but change the transaction number to "Print".  You can
enter many checks at a time this way.  They will NOT immediately print.
See the screenshot below:<br>
<br>

<br>
All checks you wish to print must be entered prior to printing the
batch. If you try to leave CBT without printing checks in the queue, it
will warn you - but it doesn't HURT to leave with checks flagged to be
printed.<br>
<br>
Once you have 2,3 or even 30 checks in your CBT register, all who's
check number says "Print" will be printed when you select "Print Checks"
from the file menu.<br>
<br>
You will then have the option of designating the starting check number,
and telling how many checks are remaining on the first page (in case you
used one of them from that page last batch.)  See the screen below:<br>
<br>

<br>
Notice that it automatically knew it was printing three checks, because
I had selected three checks as check number "Print" when I entered them
(see first screenshot.)  If last time I printed, the last page of checks
had only used one check, I'd change the number of checks on the first
page to be "2".  The starting check number would be the first check on
the first page of the preprinted forms.<br>
<br>
Once the batch is printed, all checks that were flagged for printing
will have the corresponding check number replaced in the CBT check
register, UNLESS you select "REPRINT", and then it will assume nothing
has happened.<br>
<br>
The real power comes in if you schedule a recurring transaction to be
auto-entered every month with a transaction type of "Print".  Then all
you have to do is open CBT the day your bills are due and select "Print
Checks".<br>
<br>
If printing does not seem to be aligned exactly with your forms, you
can change these settings from the "Settings" option in the "Tools"
menu.&nbsp; The "Check Printing" tab gives complete control over spacing
when printing checks.<br>
