<h4><font color="#006600">Category Management</font></h4>
When you first begin using CBT, a basic list of categories will be
created for you.&nbsp; Categories can be either Expense or Income
related and are sorted in the list appropriately.<br>
<br>
You can add, edit or delete categories from the category management
screen.&nbsp; Editing existing categories will cause all existing
transactions using that category name to have their category changed to
match the new category name.&nbsp; Deleting a category will NOT delete
the category name from a transaction currently in that category.&nbsp;
What this means is that if you delete a category and still have
transactions using it, the transactions will still show as using that
category.&nbsp; Certain category reports may not display transactions
that use invalid categories.<br>
<br>
You can also right click on a transaction within the category
transaction list and jump to that transaction in the checkbook register.<br>
