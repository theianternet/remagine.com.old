<h4><font color="#006600">Balancing Manually</font></h4>
You can manually balance your account by clicking the "Balance" button or
selecting "Balance Account" from the "Tools" menu. &nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 Enter the date of your bank statement, along with the closing balance and
the amount of any monthly fees incurred on the account through this period.
Any fees entered will automatically be entered as a new transaction and marked
as reconciled.<br>
<br>
While in balance mode, you can single click in the status column on any transaction
to toggle the cleared status. &nbsp; Mark all transactions as cleared that
appear on the bank statement. &nbsp;Once all transactions are cleared, the
"Difference" amount should be zero. &nbsp;While in balancing mode, you can
also make adjustments to transactions, or enter any missing transactions.
&nbsp;When complete click "Done". &nbsp;The "Done" button will not be available
until the account is properly balanced. &nbsp;You can also cancel balancing
and correct it later.<br>
