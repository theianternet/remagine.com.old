<h4><font color="#006600">Balancing from an OFX file</font></h4>
Many banks now offer download of OFX (Open Financial Exchange) files. &nbsp;
If your bank offers this feature on their website, you can download OFX files
and have the data within them matched up against the information already
in CheckBook Tracker. &nbsp; CBT attempts to intelligently match up transactions
using a complex set of rules.<br>
<br>
Balancing from OFX files takes much of the headache out of balancing your
checkbook. &nbsp;You can even balance your checkbook weekly or even daily,
rather than waiting for the monthly statement from your bank. &nbsp;I commonly
use a debit card and use the OFX balancing to automatically enter those transactions
into CBT.<br>
<br>
To use balancing from OFX, download the latest OFX file from your bank. &nbsp;Some
banks will even keep up with what transactions you have already downloaded
and give you the option to only download new transactions. &nbsp;This will
reduce the possibility of mismatched transactions.<br>
<br>
Once the OFX file has been downloaded from your bank, open CBT and select
"Balance from OFX" in the "Tools" menu. &nbsp;Select the OFX file.<br>
<br>
Any transactions that it thinks may have been keyed into CBT incorrectly,
or that may have some other error will pop up a confirmation box before a
match is made. &nbsp;Once the file has been imported, a summary appears showing
how many transactions were found and how many new transactions were entered
into the register. &nbsp;The checkbook register is then placed into balancing
mode, allowing you to double-check the information before completing the
balancing process.<br>
<br>
If you find that a transaction has not matched correctly, you can make adjustments
before clicking "Done."<br>
<br>
Here's a quick list of basic rules that CBT uses when matching transactions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>All transactions in the OFX file older than one day before the last
balance date are ignored</li>
  <li>Any transactions stored in CBT flagged as matched already are ignored
(as tracked by the FITID)</li>
  <li>Any transaction in the OFX that has an FITID matching a transaction
stored in CBT is ignored<br>
  </li>
  <li>Check numbers are attempted to be matched exactly</li>
  <li>If both check number and amount matches within a 15 day period, a match
is assumed</li>
  <li>If debit amount matches on a non-check transaction within a 5 day period,
a match is assumed</li>
  <li>If deposit amount matches within a 5 day period, a match is assumed</li>
  <li>Anything else may result in a confirmation request</li>
</ul>
