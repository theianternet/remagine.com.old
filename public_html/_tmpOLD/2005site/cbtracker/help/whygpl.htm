<h4><font color="#006600">What is GPL, and why did I write this
software?<br>
</font></h4>
GPL stands for the Gnu General Public Licence.&nbsp; This differs from
most software licence agreements in several dramatic ways.&nbsp; Be sure
to read the <a href="licence.htm">software licence</a> included with
this software.<br>
<br>
For one, the GPL licence spends more time GIVING you rights where a
normal software licence spends time TAKING your rights away.<br>
<br>
GPL licenced software specifically MUST be free.&nbsp; Any and all
iterations and derivitive works built on GPL software must remain
free.&nbsp; This does not mean you cannot charge a small fee for media
it is supplied on, or services provided alongside the software (such as
consulting.)<br>
<br>
GPL licenced software also requires that source code be
available.&nbsp; This makes any GPL licensed software naturally also
"OSS" or "Open Source Software" as the media is so fond of mentioning
lately.<br>
<br>
Why would you use GPL software instead of commercial products?<br>
<br>
For one, many people have access to the source code, meaning that if a
user downloads the software and wants to improve on it, add a feature,
fix a bug, etc... he can!&nbsp; But, that doesn't help the average joe
computer user with no programming experience... or does it?&nbsp; If
there are thousands of programmers who could potentially be fixing bugs
and security flaws in a particular software, everyone benefits!<br>
<br>
Another reason would be cost.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp;
Nuthin'.&nbsp; You didn't spend $40 for this software (and if you did,
someone violated the terms of the license agreement.)&nbsp; Some people
would lead you to believe you will spend more money trying to make GPL
software work than if you had just bought a commercial product to begin
with.&nbsp; While in some cases this might be true, I've gone to great
lengths to make sure it's NOT the case with CheckBook Tracker.<br>
<br>
Another would be upgradability.&nbsp; You aren't relying on one
software vendor, who might go out of business, to continue to maintain
the software.<br>
<br>
Why did I specifically choose to make this free software?&nbsp; Because
I believe in contributing back.&nbsp; I'm using Mandrake Linux right
now, and I downloaded it for free from Mandrake's website.&nbsp; I'm
writing this with Mozilla, which is free.&nbsp; I check my e-mail, run a
webserver, run a mail server (that does a darn good job filtering out
spam thank you!) and do my programming, all using FREE software.<br>
<br>
When I wanted to leave Windows behind for full-time Linux use, there
was something missing.&nbsp; Personal finance software in Linux was
either hard to install, hard to compile, hard to use, or all of the
above.&nbsp; I was hooked on using easy to use personal finance sofware
in Windows and couldn't find any FREE software for Linux that was
similar to what I wanted.&nbsp; Oh sure, there's a couple of commercial
products for Linux to do that, but nothing that was open-source or GPL
licenced.<br>
<br>
So when I came across the Lazarus programming environment (<a
 href="http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org" target="_new">http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org</a>)
which is a FREE (GPL) replacement for Kylix or Delphi Pascal object
oriented programming, I decided to write my own.&nbsp; I'm a longtime
Delphi addict and Lazarus was a perfect match.<br>
