<h4><font color="#006600">Entering Scheduled Withdrawals</font></h4>
One of the strengths of CheckBook Tracker is it's ability to store a
list of upcoming withdrawals and project them in the balance forecast
under "Cash Flow".<br>
<br>
From the "Bills" tab, you can configure new scheduled withdrawals such
as utilities, groceries, mortgage, etc.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Choose "New Withdrawal".<br>
<br>
Enter a start date, a repeating schedule (such as weekly or monthly)
and details about the transaction to be entered.<br>
<br>
These transactions will show in the CashFlow graph, projecting how much
(or little) money you will have over time.<br>
