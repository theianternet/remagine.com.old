<h4><font color="#006600">Balance Forecast &amp; Cashflow Graph</font></h4>
Right behind the register as the most important feature comes the
balance forecast page.&nbsp; Any scheduled transactions will display on
this page.&nbsp; If a transaction is past-due, it will display in red.<br>
<br>
Many functions can be done from this screen by right clicking on a
given transaction:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Right click on the next occuring transaction to enter it in the
register.&nbsp; If there is an earlier transaction that the one you
click on, this option will not be visible.</li>
  <li>Right click on the next occuring transaction to choose
"skip".&nbsp; I use this for simple budgeting by entering a recuring
transaction for food budget.&nbsp; After the budget is spent, I then
right click on the entry and choose "skip" and it moves the date
forward to the next recurrance.</li>
  <li>Right click and choose "Edit transaction" to make a change to the
single recurrance.&nbsp; This is only available on the next occurance
of a given recurring transaction.&nbsp; This comes in handy if you get
the phone bill so you now know the real amount, but don't want to write
a check for it for another two weeks.&nbsp; Right click the scheduled
transaction, choose "Edit transaction" and change the amount to match
the bill.&nbsp; An icon will appear on this line showing the
transaction has been changed from the scheduled batch.</li>
  <li>Right click and choose "Edit Series" to make a change to all
recurances for this transaction.&nbsp; This option is the same as
editing the schedule from the "Bills" page.</li>
  <li>Hove the mouse over the forecast graph to pop up the projected
balance on that day.</li>
</ul>
You will also notice that a bar keeps track in the forecast graph to
match the position of the higlighted line in the transaction list below
it.<br>
