<h4><font color="#006600">Creating a file</font></h4>
So you want to manage your finances do you? &nbsp;Well, you've come to the
right place. &nbsp;CheckBook Tracker has been designed to make it as easy
as possible.<br>
<br>
When you first open CBT (CheckBook Tracker), you'll be presented with a fairly
sparse user interface but only because no file is currently open.<br>
<br>
Your first step is to create a new file by selected "NEW" from the "FILE"
menu. &nbsp;Name the file anything you like. &nbsp;There is not file extension
added, so I tend to use "cbt.file" or maybe you will want to use "checkbook.cbt"
&nbsp;Don't worry, you won't have to remember this filename every time you
open CBT. &nbsp;From now on, the last file you used will automatically be
opened at startup.<br>
